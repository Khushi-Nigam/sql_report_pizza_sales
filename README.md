# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL

Welcome to my project on analyzing pizza sales data using Structured Query Language (SQL). This project was created to explore sales patterns, customer preferences, and business insights for a fictional pizza restaurant.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to apply SQL skills to a real-world dataset and derive actionable insights that can help improve business decisions. The analysis is structured into three levels: **Basic**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced** SQL queries.

## 🧩 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes multiple tables:
- `orders` – Order ID, order time/date
- `order_details` – Pizza name, quantity, price
- `pizza_types` – Pizza category, ingredients
- `pizza_sizes` – Sizes and related pricing

> Note: The dataset is based on a fictional pizza restaurant and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or other public repositories.
